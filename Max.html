    <h2>My Bio</h2>
    <p>My name is Max Lobato. I am 15 years old and am a student at San Rafael High School. I was born in California on December 15, 2001. My hobbies include drawing, fencing, music, video games, memes, Magic the Gathering, and collecting swords. My goals in life vary from time to time, but currently I want to pursue a career in either music, or programming. <span>My favorite quote is "To play a note incorrectly is insignificant, to play without passion is inexcusable." - Ludwig van beethoven.</span> </p>
